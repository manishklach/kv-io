## Current Read

The repo now has the shape of the full Kairo architecture, but the maturity is
intentionally uneven:

- `0001`, `0002`, `0005`, and `0009` form the Linux 6.8.x compile-targeted foundation stack
- `kernel/patches/foundation/0001` through `0004` are the preferred local apply/compile target
- `0003`, `0006`, and `0007` remain scaffold-heavy earlier stages
- `0004` remains an aggressive kernel RFC/POC path that still needs its own implement-then-validate cycle
- `0008` is now a generic backend mapping scaffold with benchmark-visible output
- the user-space harness can approximate decode, prefetch, prefill, eviction, and multisession pressure
- the benchmark now supports merge-friendly and merge-hostile access patterns
- the benchmark now also supports `--hint-mode ioprio|rwf|both` for Stage 4 experiments
- the benchmark now also supports `--semantic-mode` for Stage 5 cache-semantic experiments
- the benchmark now also supports `--model-id`, `--session-id`, `--cache-pool-id`,
  `--placement-group`, `--lifetime`, `--recompute-ok`, `--cache-pools`, and
  `--placement-groups` for Stage 6 placement/lifetime experiments

## What We Can Measure Today

- `decode_avg_us`, `decode_p50_us`, `decode_p95_us`, `decode_p99_us`
- `write_MBps`, `prefetch_read_MBps`, `evict_MBps`
- `ioprio_*_{ok,fail}`
- `rwf_*_{attempts,fail}`
- `rwf_ephemeral_*`, `rwf_recompute_*`, `rwf_no_durability_*`, `rwf_avoid_pagecache_*`
- Kairo sysfs counters: dispatch, starvation escape, merge instrumentation, request-size histogram
- Stage 5 semantic counters: ephemeral, recomputable, no-durability, avoid-pagecache, evict-cleanup
- Stage 6 placement/lifetime scaffold counters: `kairo_placement_hints`, `kairo_lifetime_*_count`, `kairo_has_*_count`
- Stage 7 backend mapping counters: `kairo_backend_mapping_attempts`, `kairo_backend_*_hints`, `kairo_backend_*_lived`/`_local`/`_persistent`
- Stage 7 benchmark output: `backend_mode`, `backend_class`, `stream_id`, `fdp_placement_id`, `zone_hint`, `backend_noop_fallback`
- counter deltas via `scripts/collect_kairo_counters.sh`

## What Needs Real Kernel Validation Next

- foundation stack boot validation and runtime counter movement on Linux 6.8.x
- `0004` merge-bias interaction with real blk-merge decisions on Linux 6.8.x
- `0003` end-to-end hint propagation from `kiocb` into block-layer metadata
- `0006` semantics around direct I/O preference, cleanup, and page-cache pollution
- `0008` feature detection, backend class mapping, and graceful fallback on generic NVMe SSDs
- Stage 6 placement/lifetime scaffold counter movement in a patched kernel
- Stage 7 backend mapping scaffold counter movement in a patched kernel
