**Kernel AI Runtime I/O for KV-cache-aware Linux storage**

Kairo is a Linux-kernel RFC/POC exploring a missing systems layer for AI inference: **storage I/O that understands KV-cache traffic, decode-critical reads, prefetch pressure, recomputable cache data, model/session locality, and backend placement intent.**

Modern AI inference is no longer just a GPU problem. Long-context models, agentic workloads, multi-session serving, KV-cache reuse, and flash-backed memory tiers are creating new storage traffic patterns that traditional block schedulers were not designed to distinguish. Today, much of this traffic still reaches the kernel as ordinary reads and writes.

Kairo asks a simple question:

> What if the Linux storage stack could understand AI inference I/O as a first-class workload?

This repository explores that question through kernel patches, benchmark tooling, tracepoint scaffolding, and Linux 6.8.x integration scripts.

---

## Why Kairo Exists

AI inference increasingly depends on memory objects that are:

* too large to keep entirely in HBM or DRAM,
* too valuable to treat as cold storage,
* latency-sensitive during decode,
* often session-scoped or model-scoped,
* frequently recomputable or short-lived,
* and increasingly backed by NVMe SSDs or flash memory tiers.

Traditional storage systems mostly see:

```text
read
write
discard
flush
```

AI runtimes know much more:

```text
decode-critical read
prefetch read
prefill write
eviction cleanup
session-local KV cache
model-local KV cache
recomputable cache
short-lived placement group
```

Kairo explores how that higher-level intent could flow into the Linux block layer and, eventually, into generic NVMe backend placement mechanisms.

---

## Core Idea

Kairo introduces a research path for classifying and scheduling AI inference I/O:

```text
AI runtime / benchmark
    -> hint path
    -> request classification
    -> mq-deadline scheduling policy
    -> semantic and placement metadata
    -> generic backend mapping scaffold
    -> tracepoint observability
```

The current implementation focuses on:

* decode-read prioritization under mixed read/write pressure,
* prefetch-aware scheduling,
* prefill-write and eviction demotion accounting,
* model/session/cache-pool/lifetime metadata,
* generic backend mapping scaffolds for Streams/FDP/ZNS-style placement,
* structured benchmark experiments,
* sysfs counters,
* and kernel tracepoint observability scaffolding.

---

## Project Status

Kairo is currently an **internal RFC/POC**.

It is not intended for LKML submission at this stage.

The repo contains two parallel tracks:

### 1. Compile-targeted Linux 6.8.x foundation stack

Located under:

```text
kernel/patches/foundation/
```

This is the smaller kernel-core subset intended for local Linux 6.8.x apply/build experiments.

It covers:

* request classification,
* `ioprio` fallback mapping,
* `mq-deadline` decode priority,
* prefetch deadline handling,
* prefill-write demotion accounting,
* eviction/discard accounting,
* and sysfs tunables/counters.

### 2. Broader RFC/POC architecture series

Located under:

```text
kernel/patches/
```

This preserves the full Kairo architecture direction, including:

* request classification,
* decode-read priority,
* prefetch/prefill/evict scheduling,
* request-shape and merge instrumentation,
* `io_uring` / `RWF_*` hint plumbing,
* ephemeral and recomputable cache semantics,
* model/session/lifetime placement metadata,
* generic NVMe backend mapping hooks,
* and tracepoint observability.

---

## Why This Matters

Kairo targets a real emerging systems problem:

> AI inference workloads are beginning to use storage as an active memory tier, but the kernel still lacks AI-aware request semantics.

Without richer I/O classification, the block layer cannot easily distinguish:

```text
A decode-critical KV-cache read
from
A background prefill write
from
A recomputable cache eviction
from
An ordinary durable application write
```

That distinction matters because decode latency can dominate perceived inference latency. If decode reads are delayed behind background writes, eviction cleanup, or poorly shaped prefetch traffic, the storage tier becomes part of the inference tail-latency problem.

Kairo explores whether Linux can expose a better path.

## Benchmark

The benchmark lives at:

```text
bench/kairo_bench.c
```

It models AI inference-like I/O using:

* decode workers,
* prefetch workers,
* prefill/write workers,
* eviction workers,
* multi-session mode,
* model/session/cache-pool/lifetime metadata,
* backend-mode modeling,
* and latency/throughput summaries.

Build:

```bash
make
```

or:

```bash
gcc -O2 -Wall -pthread -Iinclude -o kairo_bench bench/kairo_bench.c
```

---

## Temporary Hint Mapping

The current foundation path uses `ioprio` as a practical local signal:

```text
RT prio 0 read   -> decode-critical read
RT prio 1 read   -> prefetch read
BE prio 7 write  -> prefill/background write
discard/zeroes   -> eviction cleanup
```

This is intentionally temporary. The broader RFC path also explores `io_uring` and `RWF_*` hint propagation.

---

## Running Experiments

### Baseline

```bash
./scripts/run_baseline.sh /mnt/nvme/kairo.test nvme0n1
```

### Kairo POC

```bash
./scripts/set_mq_deadline.sh nvme0n1
./scripts/run_kairo_poc.sh /mnt/nvme/kairo.test nvme0n1
```

### A/B comparison

```bash
./scripts/run_ab_experiment.sh /mnt/nvme/kairo.test nvme0n1
```

### Multisession workload

```bash
./scripts/run_multisession_experiment.sh /mnt/nvme/kairo.test nvme0n1
```

### Stage 6 placement/lifetime experiment

```bash
./scripts/run_stage6_placement_experiment.sh /mnt/nvme/kairo.test nvme0n1
```

### Stage 7 backend mapping experiment

```bash
./scripts/run_stage7_backend_mapping_experiment.sh /mnt/nvme/kairo.test nvme0n1
```

### Stage 8 trace experiment

```bash
./scripts/run_stage8_trace_experiment.sh /mnt/nvme/kairo.test nvme0n1 --trace-mode none
```

On an unpatched kernel, trace experiments should still run and report tracepoint availability honestly.

---

## Success Metrics

Primary metric:

```text
decode_p99_us under mixed prefill-write pressure
```

Secondary metrics:

```text
decode_p95_us
decode_avg_us
decode_read_MBps
prefetch_read_MBps
write_MBps
eviction behavior
starvation escapes
backend mapping counters
tracepoint event counts
```

The goal is not just higher throughput. The key question is whether decode-critical I/O can be protected when background AI cache traffic competes for the same storage path.

---

## Linux 6.8 Foundation Validation

Use the Linux 6.8 integration harness:

```bash
./kernel/integration/linux-6.8/apply_foundation_stack.sh /path/to/linux-6.8.x
./kernel/integration/linux-6.8/validate_foundation_stack.sh /path/to/linux-6.8.x
./kernel/integration/linux-6.8/build_foundation_objects.sh /path/to/linux-6.8.x
```

Smoke check:

```bash
./kernel/integration/linux-6.8/smoke_foundation_stack.sh /path/to/linux-6.8.x --check-only
```

NVMe hook audit:

```bash
./kernel/integration/linux-6.8/audit_nvme_hooks.sh /path/to/linux-6.8.x --stdout
```

Tracepoint audit:

```bash
./kernel/integration/linux-6.8/audit_tracepoints.sh /path/to/linux-6.8.x --stdout
```

---

## Validation Status

Tracked validation lives in:

* [docs/tested_kernel_matrix.md](docs/tested_kernel_matrix.md)
* [docs/full_architecture_status.md](docs/full_architecture_status.md)
* [docs/kernel_foundation_stack.md](docs/kernel_foundation_stack.md)
* [docs/kernel_foundation_invariants.md](docs/kernel_foundation_invariants.md)

Current status, at a high level:

```text
Foundation patch apply:       locally validated on Linux 6.8.x path
Foundation symbol validation: locally validated
mq-deadline object build:     locally validated
Boot validation:              pending
Runtime sysfs visibility:     pending
Benchmark counter movement:   pending
Full RFC series compile:      not claimed
```

Kairo intentionally separates what is implemented, what is scaffolded, and what is validated.

## What Kairo Is Not

Kairo is not:

* a production kernel subsystem,
* a stable userspace ABI,
* an LKML-ready patch series,
* a vendor-specific SSD integration,
* or a claim of physical NVMe placement today.

Kairo is a research-grade kernel/storage prototype for exploring what AI-aware Linux storage could become.

---

## Design Principles

Kairo follows several principles:

```text
Generic before vendor-specific.
Observable before opaque.
Benchmark-driven before claims.
No-op fallback before unsafe behavior.
Foundation stack separate from architecture scaffolds.
Explicit validation status instead of overclaiming.
```
